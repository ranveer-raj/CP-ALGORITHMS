CP-ALGORITHMS
Welcome to the CP-ALGORITHMS repository! This repository contains various algorithms and data structures commonly used in competitive programming and coding interviews.

Content
The repository includes:

Sorting algorithms: Quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, etc.
Searching algorithms: Linear search, binary search, etc.
Graph algorithms: Breadth-first search, depth-first search, shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), etc.
Dynamic programming algorithms: Longest common subsequence, knapsack problem, etc.
Segment Tree: Segment Tree and its variants like lazy propagation
Miscellaneous: Bit manipulation, permutations and combinations, etc.
Each algorithm has its own folder with a detailed explanation of the problem and the solution in the form of code, comments and an explanation of the time and space complexities.

Usage
To use the code in this repository, simply clone or download the repository and navigate to the appropriate folder for the algorithm you wish to use. You can then run the code on your local machine using a suitable compiler or IDE.

It's highly recommended to use the provided test cases to get familiar with the problem and the solution, and also you can add your own test cases to make sure the implementation is correct and understand the edge cases.
